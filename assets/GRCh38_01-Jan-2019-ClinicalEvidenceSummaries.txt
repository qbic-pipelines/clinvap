This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

COG-N-453x and SH-SY5Y xenografts showed some inhibition when treated with crizotinib, but showed complete growth inhibition with PF-06463922 treatment.  This corresponded to 0% event free survival (EFS) in these mice by 6 weeks with crizotinib treatment, but 100% EFS with PF-06463922 treatment. Comparison of crizotinib and PF-06463922 growth inhibition in F1174L cells SH-SY5Y, NBSD 415-IMDM and KELLY showed increased sensitivity to PF-06463922, as compared to crizotinib. Inhibition effects were not seen on neuroblastoma cells with wild type ALK (NB-EBc1, SK-N-BE(2)C). Decreased phosphorylation on ALK tyrosine 1278 was seen with PF-06463922 over crizotinib at 10 and 100 nM concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

There was no significant difference in overall survival between wild-type patients and patients with any type of exon-12 mutation. However, patients with the G12D mutation exhibited significantly lower overall survival compared to wild-type patients in univariate and multivariate analyses. This difference in overall survival between wild-type and G12D patients persisted in the subset of patients who underwent chemotherapy at any point after enrollment.	27010960	Bournet et al., 2016, Clin Transl Gastroenterol		3.0	accepted	1732	79	30	C	T	75.0	GRCh38	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS.

G12C, G12D and G12V were the most common mutations (46%, 22%, 11%, respectively). Patients with G12C or G12V mutations had a trend towards longer OS, PFS and ORR compared to other KRAS mutations. Changes in tumor size were similar between groups with the best responses in tumors with G12V mutations. Few differences were observed between groups when treated with docetaxel + placebo.	26125448	Jänne et al., 2015, Br. J.

Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	26739882	Patricelli et al., 2016, Cancer Discov		3.0	accepted	1173	78	30	C	A	75.0	GRCh38	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated.

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.

In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations.

The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This patient was a 38 year old female with stage IV M1a melanoma who took dabrafenib (35 mg twice daily to 100 mg three times a day). The best overall response was a 100% reduction in the sum of target lesions, and progression free survival lasted 119 days. Prior to dabrafenib monotherapy, this patient's baseline tumor harbored BRAF V600K—no other somatic alterations were noted. Following relapse, the patient gained AKT1 Q79K in one of two disease progressive tumors. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger re-sequencing were used for all tumors. The authors hypothesized that disruptions in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway represent a core mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy.	24265155	Shi et al., 2014, Cancer Discov		4.0	accepted	6260	169	2	G	T	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6260	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/169	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/2

Despite high CHR in patients with the F317L variant, of the 63 variants considered, the authors associate T315I, F317L, and V299L with resistance or lower levels of response to dasatinib due to clinical resistance and low in vitro sensitivity. They suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients with these three variants.	19779040	Müller et al., 2009, Blood		3.0	accepted	6309	241	4	T	C	75.0	GRCh38	BCR-ABL F317L, like the similar BCR-ABL T315I mutation, is becoming a common clinical marker for resistance to front-line therapies in CML.

This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).	27034505	Jennis et al., 2016, Genes Dev.		2.0	accepted	1209	504	45	G	A	75.0	GRCh38		Germline Polymorphism	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1209	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/504	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/45

A FGFR1 N546K mutation was detected in one patient. Gain of the FGFR1 locus (qPCR) was observed in 13 of 41 patients (31.7%) and Ewing sarcoma cell lines (A673, CADO, SK-NMC, SK-ES, and VH-64). FGFR1 was also highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma (mRNA and IHC) and correlated with copy number. Retroviral transduction of FGFR1 wild-type or the FGFR1 N546K mutant into NIH3T3 cells led to enhanced proliferation especially for cells harboring the FGFR1 mutation. ShRNA mediated knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma and other cancer cells (A549 lung carcinoma cell line or leukemia cell lines HL60 and Kasumi) with almost complete growth suppression only in the Ewing sarcoma cell lines and knockdown of FGFR1 abrogated growth of cell lines in xenograft. Ponatinib treatment inhibited growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines.	26179511	Agelopoulos et al., 2015, Clin.

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells.

Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered Ba/F3 cells moderately less susceptible to crizotinib than ectopic EML4-ALK.	25228534	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.	25228534	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.	25228534	Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Because of this mutation's rarity and the variability of responses of treated cases, its exact prognostic and predictive role is not fully understood. In our experience, S768I mutations in isolation do not necessarily confer sensitivity to erlotinib, but in conjunction with sensitizing EGFR mutations, S768I mutations do not restrict efficacy.	27211795	Leventakos et al., 2016, J Thorac Oncol		2.0	accepted	2906	562	19	G	T	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2906	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/562	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/19

Cancer diagnosis was more common in G84E carriers than in non-carriers (51.5% vs 30.6%, P = 0.004). G84E was highly prevalent in patients with prostate cancer than those without cancer (P < 0.0001). Evidence also supported a possible link between G84E with bladder cancer (P = 0.06) and leukemia (P = 0.01). Patient family history indicated a history of prostate cancer with a first degree relative was more common when compared to non-carriers (36.2% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.0003).	26108461	Beebe-Dimmer et al., 2015, Cancer Epidemiol.

R173C was one of four mutations (out of 42 tested) that displayed no significant phosphatase activity against either substrate, indicating, by this assay, that the mutation negatively impacts the function of PTEN.   However this mutation did not affect the ability of PTEN to bind lipid membranes in-vivo.

The proband died at 2 years due to a fatal chylothorax, having been seen at 1 year with progressive dyspnoea and displaying extensive lymphatic and venus malformations that displaced the right lung, as well as osteolytic lesions of the bones.  Proband's mother and two siblings (one 7 years and one 7 months) also carried the PTEN R173C mutation and were thus far asymptomatic. The mother's parents did not carry the R173C mutation.

Two patients achieved a durable complete response, two achieved a durable partial response, and 5 achieved stable disease >12 weeks with a median survival of 46.3 weeks. One patient harboring a somatic D820Y mutation at roughly 50% variant allele frequency (1:1 with wild type) displayed Imatinib mesylate–resistance and disease progression, which is consistent with resistant mechanisms described in Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumors.	21642685	Carvajal et al., 2011, JAMA		3.0	accepted	2886	986	29	G	T	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2886	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/986	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/29

Two of 19 melanomas examined harbored KIT mutations, with one subject harboring mutation at D820Y.  The SM3 cell line harboring a D820Y mutation showed significant growth inhibition with sunitinib exposures of 1uM and 10uM. The authors comment that this indicates a potential role for sunitinib in growth inhibition of acral melanomas.	19035443	Ashida et al., 2009, Int. J.

KIT was amplified in the tumor and harbored the K642E mutation. Post surgery with extensive margins, she was given a dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and adjuvant radiation therapy for 2.5 weeks.  Two weeks post radiation she developed nodules in the same region and testing indicated they were malignant melanoma with high KIT expression. She enrolled in a clinical trial with a dose of 400mg imatinib per day (Nov 2006). Less than 4 weeks later, all nodules had disappeared. Upon a lowered dosage to 200mg of imatinib, the nodules returned and subsequently the dosage was increased to 600mg/day. The patient remained melanoma-free on 600mg imatinib until a follow up in Jan 2008. The authors do not provide further details on patient outcome.	18510589	Lutzky et al., 2008, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res		2.0	accepted	2889	978	29	A	G	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2889	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/978	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/29
10	43113622	43113622	RET	5979	C609Y	Thyroid Medullary Carcinoma	3973.0				Predisposing	Supports	B	Pathogenic	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	Calva et al., 2009, Ann. Surg.

It has been widely reported in both familial and sporadic cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with medullary thyroid cancers. Despite extensive WGS and Exome coverage for a combined total of ~150k alleles in the GNOMAD browser, this variant has never been observed.

The majority of patients were smokers (97%). There was no association with age, sex, race, or stage. The most common mutations were K57N (64%, 23/36) followed by Q56P (19%, 7/36), all mutually exclusive with other driver mutations in the targeted panel.  MEK1 mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the EGFR signaling pathway (i.e., EGFR, HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF). Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, MEK1 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/F3 cells. A selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, inhibits mutant-induced ERK activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/F3 cells.	18632602	Marks et al., 2008, Cancer Res.		2.0	accepted	2936	1272	31	G	T	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2936	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1272	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/31

A mutation in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene was identified in 223 (88%) of the 254 cases. The CTNNB1 mutation spectra concerned mainly three point mutations in two codons (41 and 45): T41A was identified in 132 cases (59%); S45F was identified in 49 samples (22%); and S45P was identified in 27 samples (12%). None of the 175 lesions mimicking desmoid tumors analyzed harbored any CTNNB1 mutations.	22766794	Le Guellec et al., 2012, Mod.

The VHL type 1 family of 4 affected individuals had 2 patients with retinal angiomas, 5 with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, and one with renal cell carcinoma (family VHL 53). The VHL type 2B family of 3 affected individuals had one patient with retinal angioma, 3 with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, one with pheochromocytoma, one with renal cell carcinoma, one with pancreatic cysts, and one with cystadenomas of the epididymis (family VHL 9). This study contains supporting evidence of pathogenicity due to cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease (ACMG code: PP1). HPO terms: papillary cystadenomas of the broad ligament, retinal hemangioblastoma, hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, multiple pancreatic cysts.	8707293	Glavac et al., 1996, Hum.

Resulting clones were grown in a range of tyrosine kinase inhibitor concentrations to identify resistance mutations. The V379I mutation was associated with resistance in 2 μM imatinib (2 clones recovered, ~1%). In a review of 20 publications, this mutation was previously described in imatinib resistant patients.	16772610	Bradeen et al., 2006, Blood		2.0	accepted	6257	1609	4	G	A	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6257	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1609	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4

In the larger cohort, patients with tumors harboring any KRAS mutation had significantly decreased incidence of objective response than patients with wtKRAS tumors. Authors noted that patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations tended to have decreased PFS and OS compared to those with wild-type tumors though the differences were not statistically significant.	19223544	Sartore-Bianchi et al., 2009, Cancer Res.		2.0	accepted	6312	1517	30	GC	AA	75.0	GRCh38		Somatic Mutation	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6312	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1517	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30
